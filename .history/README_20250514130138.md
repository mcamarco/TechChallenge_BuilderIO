# Welcome to the Sales Engineer Tech Challenge!

## Intro
In order to showcase your skills, you’ll have the opportunity to build a real solution that leverages the Builder.io visual development platform. Your solution must solve the business use case illustrated below, delivering the specific features in the Solution section.

Be sure to check out the FAQ section for answers to important questions.

## Use Case
SaaS4U is a developer-friendly SaaS platform that collects AI-supported customer data globally. Everybody seems to love their cloud-hosted solution, especially developers! They’re in the process of modernizing their digital presence and have engaged with Builder.io for their web and mobile app needs.

Leadership at SaaS4U understands that their current application tech stack is hard to maintain and consumes a lot of engineering resources. They’ve noted the following challenges:
- The development team would like to offload updates to the website content off to the marketing and content teams. Currently, every update to the content on the site requires a re-deploy of their headless stack that the engineers have to manage.
- The marketing team would like their website to have content targeted towards specific groups of customers. Customer data from SaaS4U will be used to drive marketing campaigns to deepen their already loyal customer base and appeal to new customers.
- The content team would like the new solution to provide an easy way to push out new content, such as developer blog posts and product case studies. The content team wants to create this content from reusable templates. They would also like to focus on localizing their developer content in the future.

## Solution
As a Sales Engineer, your task is to build a proof-of-concept app that illustrates how our prospective customer SaaS4U can solve the use case challenges outlined above. To get started, you may leverage one of the example repositories found in the Builder.io documentation website.

## Let’s Get Started
1. Clone one of the example repositories from Builder.io, such as the `vcp-sample-app` repository.
2. Sign up for a Builder.io account (https://builder.io/signup) and select a “Publish” Space type.
   - Note, you’ll be shown instructions for either integrating with an existing project or starting from a net-new project. Follow the steps to integrate with the existing repository you cloned in Step 1.
3. Spend some time getting familiar with the Builder.io documentation (http://builder.io/docs/).
4. Deploy the frontend of the application to your host of choice.
5. Set the Preview URL within Builder so our marketing and content teams can preview content without needing to run an app locally using localhost.
6. Create a reusable template for our content team so they can easily push out new content. Then, use this template to create a set of localized pages that show different content based on the user’s locale.
7. The marketing team would like users to select their own locales. Register a custom component that allows users to pick their preferred locale.
8. The page should show content based on the locale the user selects.
9. That’s it! Be prepared to discuss implementation details and design choices.

## FAQ

1. **How long will the challenge take?**
   - It should only take a few days to complete.

2. **What are the deliverables?**
   - A Git repository with your application’s source code
   - Your fully functional application hosted on a cloud provider. [Vercel](https://vercel.com/signup) provides a free plan, but your app can be hosted wherever you choose.

3. **Can I ask questions or get help?**
   - We are happy to provide some general guidance, especially if you run into any technical blockers. However, the challenge is designed to see how effectively you can evaluate a use case and translate that into a solution using Builder.io.

## Features Implemented

1. **Reusable Templates**
   - Created a reusable template and forced new entries to use said template

2. **Locale Selector**
   - Built a custom component to allow users to select their language: English (US), English (UK), or Spanish (ES).
   - Dynamically fetch content based on the selected locale.
   - Integrated the custom component by adding it to the `builder-registry.ts`.

 Custom Targeting allows users to

## Steps to Completion

### 1. Clone and Setup
- Cloned the `vcp-sample-app` repository from Builder.io.
- Integrated it with a Builder.io account.

### 2. Customizations
- **Locale Selector Component**
  - Added a dropdown for locale selection.
  - Registered the component in `builder-registry.ts`.
- **Updated `[...page]/page.tsx`**

## Technical Implementation

### Locale Selector Code
```typescript name=components/Locale/LocaleSelector.tsx
"use client";
import React from "react";

interface LocaleSelectorProps {
  locale: string; // Current locale
  onChange: (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLSelectElement>) => void; // Change handler
}

const localeOptions = [
  { label: "English (US)", value: "en-US" },
  { label: "English (UK)", value: "en-GB" },
  { label: "Spanish (ES)", value: "es-ES" },
];

const LocaleSelector: React.FC<LocaleSelectorProps> = ({
  locale,
  onChange,
}) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <label htmlFor="locale-select" style={{ marginRight: "1em" }}>
        Select Language:
      </label>
      <select
        id="locale-select"
        value={locale}
        onChange={onChange}
        style={{ padding: "0.5em 1em" }}
      >
        {localeOptions.map((opt) => (
          <option key={opt.value} value={opt.value}>
            {opt.label}
          </option>
        ))}
      </select>
    </div>
  );
};

export default LocaleSelector;
```

### Locale Selector Registration
```typescript name=builder-registry.ts
Builder.registerComponent(LocaleSelector, {
  name: "Locale Selector",
  inputs: [
    {
      name: "initialLocale",
      type: "string",
      enum: [
        { label: "English (US)", value: "en-US" },
        { label: "English (UK)", value: "en-GB" },
        { label: "Spanish (ES)", value: "es-ES" },
      ],
      defaultValue: "en-US",
    },
  ],
});
```

### `[...page]/page.tsx` Updates
```typescript name=app/[...page]/page.tsx
"use client";
import { builder } from "@builder.io/sdk";
import { RenderBuilderContent } from "../../components/builder";
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import LocaleSelector from "@/components/Locale/LocaleSelector";

builder.init(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BUILDER_API_KEY!);

export default function Page(props) {
  const [locale, setLocale] = useState("en-US");
  const [content, setContent] = useState(null);

  const handleChange = (e) => {
    const newLocale = e.target.value;
    if (newLocale !== locale) {
      setLocale(newLocale);
      builder.setUserAttributes({ locale: newLocale });
    }
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchContent = async () => {
      try {
        const fetchedContent = await builder
          .get("page", {
            userAttributes: {
              urlPath: "/" + (props?.params?.page?.join("/") || ""),
              locale: [locale],
            },
          })
          .toPromise();
        setContent(fetchedContent);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error fetching content:", error);
      }
    };

    fetchContent();
  }, [locale, props?.params?.page]);

  return (
    <>
      <LocaleSelector locale={locale} onChange={handleChange} />
      <RenderBuilderContent content={content} model="page" options={{ enrich: true }} />
    </>
  );
}
```
