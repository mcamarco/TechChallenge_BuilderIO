# SaaS4U Modernized Application Challenge

## Intro

This project is a proof-of-concept application that leverages the Builder.io visual development platform to solve SaaS4U's business challenges. SaaS4U is a developer-friendly SaaS platform that collects AI-supported customer data globally. The company is modernizing its digital presence and has engaged Builder.io for their web and mobile app needs.

The purpose of this challenge is to demonstrate how Builder.io can address SaaS4U's requirements by enabling seamless content management, targeted marketing, and localized experiences.

---

## Use Case

SaaS4U faces the following challenges:

- **Development Team:** They want to offload website content updates to the marketing and content teams, eliminating the need for engineers to manage redeployments for every content change.
- **Marketing Team:** They want the website to deliver targeted content for specific customer groups (e.g., region, behavior, subscription type) to deepen customer loyalty and attract new customers.
- **Content Team:** They want an easy way to push out new content (e.g., developer blog posts, product case studies) using reusable templates. They also aim to localize developer content in the future.

## Solution

The solution addresses SaaS4U's challenges by building a proof-of-concept app that illustrates how Builder.io can integrate seamlessly into their workflow:

1. **Clone a Repository:**
   - Use one of the example repositories from Builder.io, such as the `vcp-sample-app` repository.

2. **Sign Up for Builder.io:**
   - Create a Builder.io account ([Sign Up](https://builder.io/signup)) and select a "Publish" space type.
   - Follow the integration steps for the cloned repository.

3. **Understand Builder.io:**
   - Spend time reading the [Builder.io documentation](https://builder.io/docs/) to familiarize yourself with the platform.

4. **Deploy the Application:**
   - Deploy the frontend of the application to a hosting platform of your choice (e.g., [Vercel](https://vercel.com/signup)).

5. **Set Preview URL:**
   - Configure the Preview URL within Builder.io so marketing and content teams can preview content without needing to run the app locally.
   - Page Settings > Preview URL

6. **Reusable Templates:**
   - Create a reusable template for the content team to push out new content easily (e.g., developer blog posts, product case studies).
   - 

7. **Localized Content:**
   - Use the reusable template to create a set of localized pages that show different content based on the user’s locale.

8. **User Locale Selection:**
   - Register a custom component that allows users to pick their preferred locale.
   - Ensure the page dynamically shows content based on the locale the user selects.

2. **Deployed Application:**
   - The fully functional application should be hosted on a cloud provider of your choice (e.g., Vercel).
