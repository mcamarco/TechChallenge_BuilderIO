# SaaS4U Modernized Application

## Overview
SaaS4U is a developer-friendly SaaS platform that collects AI-supported customer data globally. Everybody seems to love their cloud-hosted solution, especially developers! They’re in the process of modernizing their digital presence and have engaged with Builder.io for their web and mobile app needs. 

Leadership at SaaS4U understands that their current application tech stack is hard to maintain and consumes a lot of engineering resources. They’ve noted the following challenges: 

- The development team would like to offload updates to the website content off to the marketing and content teams. Currently, every update to the content on the site requires a re-deploy of their headless stack that the engineers have to manage. 
- The marketing team would like their website to have content targeted towards specific groups of customers. Customer data from SaaS4U will be used to drive marketing campaigns to deepen their already loyal customer base and appeal to new customers. 
- The content team would like the new solution to provide an easy way to push out new content, such as developer blog posts and product case studies. The content team wants to create this content from reusable templates. They would also like to focus on localizing their developer content in the future.

## Solution

1. Clone Repository: `vcp-sample-app`
2. Confirm the API Integration by adding `.env` file, set var `NEXT_PUBLIC_BUILDER_API_KEY`
3. Deploy Front End to Vercel
   - Add environment variable with the API key
4. Set the Preview URL within Builder ([steps here](https://www.builder.io/c/docs/dynamic-preview-urls))
   - This is so that marketing/content teams can preview content without needing to run an app locally using `localhost`
5. Create reusable template for content team
6. Using templates, create a set of localized pages to show different content based on user locale
7. Register a custom component that allows users to pick their preferred locale, the page should show content based on the locale the user selects

## Deliverables
1. **GIT Repository with Source Code**
2. **Fully Functional App Link on Vercel**
